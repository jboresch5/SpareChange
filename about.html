		<h2>About</h2>
			<p id = "aboutsections">Developed in 2019, SpareChange is the premier technology platform 
			for fantasy bowling. By joining a league, bowling fans can interact and 
			compete against each other by managing a team of PBA players throughout 
			the season. Each PBA national tournament represents a fantasy matchup 
			where league members compete against each other in an <i>All Play</i> or 
			<i>Total Points</i> style format. Team owners must fill their lineup prior to 
			each match up by choosing players from the tournament roster. However, each 
			player has a corresponding salary and each team must stay below the salary 
			cap set by the league commissioner. Players are awarded fantasy points 
			through the SpareChange scoring system based on their performance throughout 
			the tournament. Once the tournament has concluded, matchup winners will be 
			determined by the total points scored by the team of bowlers.</p>

		<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p id="aboutsections">With no active fantasy bowling sites on the Internet, two college roommates 
			merged their passions for bowling, statistics, and technology to draft a plan to 
			bring bowling into the ever-growing world of fantasy sports. Once the PBA
			expanded their tournament schedule for the 2019 season and
			inked a multi-year television agreement with FOX Sports, there was no better time to 
			turn the idea into a reality. While development began, the 2019 season was tracked 
			manually with friends to gauge interest and test different rules and formats. In January 
			2019, the web application was built and ready to launch. The rest is history.</p>
